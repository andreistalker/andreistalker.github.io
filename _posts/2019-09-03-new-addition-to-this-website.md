I've added a dynamic background to the website, some **bubbles** that float around and change the trajectory once they hit the edge of the browser.

You can click anywhere on this website and create bubbles! But we can only have, unfortunately, 70 bubbles at one time. If you resize the browser, new bubbles will generate!
